# Matplotlib_Challenge

## Pymaceuticals 
The dataset for this activity contains 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

Following steps are carried out on the data:

1. Cleaning the data to remove any mouse ID with duplicate time points

2. DataFrame of summary statistics with a column for each of the following statistics: mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume.

3. Bar charts to show the total total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen throughout the study

4. Pie charts to show the distribution of female versus male mice in the study
   
5. Calculating the Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Creating a Box Plot for final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin

6. Creating a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot for a single mouse that was treated with Capomulin

7. Calculating the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen
